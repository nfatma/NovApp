# NovApp
I made this app during my learning period of Android app Development.

It contains all the basic elements of an Android application such as
1. Basic Java Coding 
2. Navigation buttons
3. Checkbox Buttons, Radio Buttons,toggle Buttons
4. Splash Screen
5. camera intent
6. Spinner
7. UserPrompt
8. Actionbar
9. List View
10. AudioPlayer, VideoPlayer
11. SharedPreference
12. FileDemo
13. Database, DatabaseUsingHandler
14. RecyclerView
15. ApiCalling
16. Fragment Demo
17. FireBaseDemo. 

As learning never ends, I still add new things that I learn to this app.
